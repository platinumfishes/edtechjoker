## Front end Developer
A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer. Front-end developers create the user interface (UI) that determines what each part of a site or application does and how it will look.

## SEO

SEO works through search engines using bots to crawl webpages and put them into an index, the indexes are the analyzed by algorithms which then allow the SEO process to take place.

## Angular
Angular is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations

## React
React is used to build interactive user interfaces and web applications using smaller amounts of code than one would need when using vanilla JS. By creating reusable components that can be thought of as building blocks, you can more easily develop applications. https://blog.hubspot.com/website/react-js#:~:text=It's%20used%20for%20building%20interactive,of%20as%20independent%20Lego%20blocks. 

## Vue.js

Vue.js is a front end JavaScript framework used for building user applications and interfaces. Similar yet different from React and Angular, Vue can be used in conjunction with frameworks like Electron to build both web applications and mobile and desktop apps. With its main feature being incremental adoption, Vue is one of the most easily adoptable JavaScript frameworks, allowing you to slowly implement Vue into an existing project rather than having to implement it all at once. The one big drawback of Vue is that it remains exclusively focued on the view layer, meaning that to build functionality such as routing, build tooling, and state management, you need to use external supporting libraries and packages.
Vue.js is an open source framework/library that is primarily used for UI development and Design. Focused on the View Layer only hence the name.
